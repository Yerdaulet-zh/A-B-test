    "### An example to consider\n",
    "To illustrate the concepts applied in hypothesis testing about a population, let's consider this example. A ceritan arbitary type of a vaccine for cold is kwown to be effective for only 25% after a period of 2 years. Researchers decided to test more expensive vaccine to determine if it is superior in providing protection against the same virus for the same period of time as former. 20 people were selected unbiasedly and inoculated. (In practise the number of participants receiving the vaccine would be serveral thousand. For the sake of simplicity in understaning the matrials, 20 people were chosen.) The alternating vaccine surpass the 2 years of period with 8 participans without contracting the virus, the expancive vaccine will be considered superior to the one presently in use. The requirement for 8 people is kind of arbitary but it appears reasonable modest gain over the 5 people who could be expected to receive protection if the 20 people had beed inoculated with the current vaccine. The null hypothesis will say that the current and more expensive one are equally effective, do difference in probabilities. The alternative hypothesis is that the expensive vaccine is superior. This is same to testing hypothesis that the binomial parameter for the probability of a success on a given trial is p =1/4 against the alternative p>1/4. This is usually written as follows: \n",

    "Those numbers less than or equal to 8 and those greater than 8. All possbile values which greater than 8 are considerend to be in **critical region**.

Thus, if x > 8, we reject $H_0$ in favor of the alternative hypothesis $H_1$. if x <= 8, we fail to reject $H_0$. This decision criterion can be visualised as follows:\n",

Fortunatelly, **the probability of commiting both types of error can be reduced by increasing the sample size**. Consider the same problem using a random sample of 100 individuals. If more than 36 of the group surpass the 2-year period, we reject tje null hypothesis that p=1/4 and accept the alternative hypothesis that p > 1/4. The critical value is now 36.
